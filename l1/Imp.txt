➡️V8 is Google's high-performance JavaScript and WebAssembly engine, which is widely used in modern web browsers and server environments. It is an open-source project written in C++ and is primarily used in Google Chrome and Node.js to execute JavaScript code efficiently. Here’s an overview of its key features and significance:

➡️Key Features of V8
High Performance:
V8 compiles JavaScript code into machine code rather than interpreting it, which significantly speeds up execution. This compilation happens just-in-time (JIT) during runtime using techniques like:

Ignition: A fast interpreter that executes JavaScript.
TurboFan: An optimizing compiler for generating highly optimized machine code.
Memory Management:
V8 manages memory allocation and garbage collection efficiently, making it suitable for both client-side and server-side JavaScript execution.

WebAssembly Support:
V8 supports WebAssembly (Wasm), allowing the execution of compiled code alongside JavaScript, improving performance for computation-heavy applications.

Cross-Platform:
V8 is designed to run on multiple operating systems, including Windows, macOS, and Linux.

Integration with Node.js:
Node.js uses V8 as its JavaScript engine, enabling developers to run JavaScript on the server side. This combination has made JavaScript one of the most popular programming languages for backend development.

➡️ Why Is V8 Important?
Fast Execution of JavaScript:
Its JIT compilation and optimization techniques ensure faster execution of JavaScript code, which is crucial for modern web applications.

Ecosystem Growth:
The development of Node.js (built on V8) expanded JavaScript's role from a browser-only language to a full-stack programming language, enabling its use in server-side development.

Basis for Other Projects:
Projects like Deno (a modern runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript) and Electron (for building cross-platform desktop apps) are also built on V8.

➡️How V8 Works
Parsing:
V8 first parses the JavaScript code and converts it into an abstract syntax tree (AST).

Ignition (Interpreter):
The AST is then translated into bytecode by Ignition, which executes it directly.

TurboFan (Optimizing Compiler):
During execution, TurboFan analyzes the code and generates highly optimized machine code for performance-critical parts.

Garbage Collection:
Unused memory is automatically cleaned up by V8’s garbage collector to ensure efficient memory use.

➡️Example Use Cases
Web Browsers: Chrome, Microsoft Edge (based on Chromium) use V8 to execute JavaScript in web pages.
Server-side: Node.js relies on V8 for executing JavaScript on the server.
Desktop Applications: Frameworks like Electron use V8 for running JavaScript in desktop applications.
